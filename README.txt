Requires at least: 3.6

This plugin will search through recent tweets with embedded photos (containing a certain hashtag), and import those photos along with the tweet into WP's media gallery.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the WPGrabTwitterPics folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Update a key term in the options, click the "grab" button in the grab area and watch the magic (look in your media area). My test hashtag is #confrz.

== What Will I Need? ==

You need to apply to Twitter to obtain a consumer key and consumer secret. You also need a setOAuthToken and setOAuthTokenSecret. All four of these you can update in the settings screen.
